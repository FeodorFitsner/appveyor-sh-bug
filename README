Simple script example to demonstrate bug Appveyor bug 4150 [1]

The symptoms are that some shell scripts run under MSYS2's sh (which
seems to be bash) give errors like

    ./configure: line 560: 0: Bad file descriptor

(this is a moderately common example, according to Google, and the one
that bit me when trying to build Emacs).
